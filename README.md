# seattle-sunrise

## Dev instructions
1) `docker-compose build` to build the container
2) `docker-compose run sunrise bash` to start a shell in the container
3) you can now either run your command `basic_alarm` (or any from ./bin); if you edit the files from your host OS, they are mounted and will apply immediately
